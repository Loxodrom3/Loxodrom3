Hello!  I am Jon Proctor

I am using github as remote drive for storing and sharing scripts and projects that I have been working on so that I have access to the projects from any of the platforms that I am currently using.  This has greatly simplified sharing scripts between my windows and raspberry pi environments.

I am currently working with R-Project, python, CircuitPython/ MicroPython.

I am working with the following devices:
- Raspberry pi 4
- Raspberry pi pico
- Raspberry pi zero w
- adafruit feather M4 express
- adafruit feather RP2040

My Interest are:
- Geospatial data collection and processing
- calculating and reporting the accuracy of geospatial data
- LED clocks - unique displays
- temperature, humidity, environmental sensors.  Collection of data and display.
- macro keyboards (rasp pi pico is to blame for this!)
- enhancing costumes for kids

Please contact me if you share similar interest!
